# project site

An attempt to build a portfolio site for a designer friend to update his outdated wordpress site.
HTML, CSS and adding minimal JS and JQuery functionality as I progress.

I used Bootstrap mostly for the layout and styling

The cards on the front page are clickable links, using javascript, to the gallery pages for each section.
I;ve used JQuery for the nav bar scrolling and to fill the image modals within the gallery pages.
